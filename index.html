        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a 23 year old self-taught Front End Developer from Houston, Texas.</p>

          <p>In July of 2019 I felt that I wasn't truly happy working in the construction industry. So I decided that I was going to pursue my true passion of becoming a frontend developer. I would quickly make a habit of waking up at 4am in the morning so that I could study and practice before I'd have to go into work at 6am</p>
          
          <p>By September 2019, I thought it would be a good idea to start documenting my journey of becoming a developer to inspire others as well as keep myself acountable. So I started my Instagram and posted daily, talking about the progress I was making and what concepts I was currently learning.</p>
          
          <p>I mainly learned from taking online courses on Udemy such as The Web Developer Bootcamp, The Complete JavaScript Course 2020, Modern React with Redux, The Complete React Native + Hooks Course plus many others!</p>
          
          <p>I am constantly pushing myself out of my comfort zone to learn more and make my dreams come true. All the while inspiring others to do the same and pursue what makes them truly happy!</p>
